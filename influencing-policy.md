# Influencing policy

The finished calculator should be interesting for everyone working on energy and climate change issues, but to make it something more than just a fun tool, it needs to be used by those with power and influence. It should be used to bring real scientific evidence into the debate around energy issues, and in turn to inform decision making.    

When discussing strategy and policy, the calculator tool can be used to create a common language to test out different scenarios. By laying out all the options that are technically possible in front of you, it lets you easily compare different combinations and see their implications.

## Testing existing policies using the calculator

A good starting point is to use the calculator to evaluate the policies you already have in place. Do your policies align with the key messages of the calculator? Are your policies aimed at the right things, and are they ambitious enough? Are you actually promoting technologies or interventions that will have little impact, or even a negative impact, in the future? A short bit of analysis looking at these questions could be circulated to policy teams so that they are aware. 

Alternatively, you could create a “current policies” pathway using the calculator. To do this you need to convert government aims or progress into choices on each of the levers. In practice this can be quite difficult, as the aims of each policy may not have been expressed in terms that the calculator uses. Quantifiable predictions in terms of efficiency, supply or demand may not have been released, and adding up the impacts of different policies can be very complicated. However, even a rough pathway can be useful in internal discussions, helping you to find gaps in your plan. 

## Developing new plans and policies

The calculator can be used to inform the strategic direction of a country or region’s energy or climate change policy. The key messages you have learnt from the calculator should be your starting point. If your existing strategy does not match these, then consider changing it. You want your policies to concentrate on the levers that make the most difference.  

Because of the huge uncertainty around many of the options available in the calculator (for example, the deployment of carbon capture and storage technologies [CCS] at scale), it may be best not to set a strict pathway for the country or region at this point. 2050 is still quite a long way away. Consider releasing a few possible pathways instead.

You should consider a range of factors when developing your plans, as there are trade offs that need to be balanced in lots of areas. Potential co-benefits (for example around energy security, forests, air quality and gender equality) should be taken into account when choosing a pathway and a plan to implement it. 

## Data management and data reporting

Many countries, particularly developing ones, have limited emissions and energy reporting capability. A calculator can provide an easy way of recording the past and reporting progress.

In most calculators built so far, the modelling begins at a single base year, which is as close to the present day as possible. However, there is no reason why historical information cannot be put into the model so that it stretches back in time with real data, and also looks to the future. Once complete, it could be updated regularly as each year’s statistics come in, so that it becomes a record of the country or region’s energy and emissions. As well as making reporting easier, this could actually improve the user experience with the traditional forward-looking aspects of the calculator, as future scenarios can be easily compared to past trends. 

## Box: The calculator and UN reporting	

Under the UNFCCC Paris Agreement, countries have set Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) targets and will be required to report on their progress towards meeting them. The calculator could be used by countries in drawing up their plans for meeting their NDC. With the calculator you can model your current energy requirements and emissions profile, map your business as usual scenario, and monitor progress against your goals. You can then see all your options and identify those that make the most difference, and even examine the cost associated with them. Evidence from the calculator can make your plans more robust, accurate and credible. However, care must be taken if using the Calculator to monitor actual progress because of the specific UNFCCC guidelines for reporting emissions. It may be possible to align the Calculator to the categories used in inventories if required, but this could have design implications on the model.
